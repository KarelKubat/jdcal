/*
Package jdcal provides conversions from dates on the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar and vice versa, and knows about zones (geographical locations) where such switches occurred, and at which dates. Holidays that depend on moon phases (e.g., Easter) can be computed.

Furthermore helper functions are provided for small tasks, such as: date validation, is a year a leap year (which depends on the calendar type), comparisons between dates (before/after/equal), advancing a date while honoring leap years.

The distribution also contains a CLI main/jdcal/jdcal.go which provides a command line interface.
